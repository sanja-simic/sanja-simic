I am Sanja Simic 22 years old, fourth year student of Applied Software Engineering at the University of Novi Sad.
I'm eager for new knowledge, and I'm currently focusing on web programming at university.
The skills I have are from areas such as C, C++, C#, Java, Python, VHDL, Assembler, Julia and many more.
